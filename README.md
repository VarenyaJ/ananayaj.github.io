A somewhat responsive personal portfolio website, which should work for all devices, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and of course - Varenya Jain classics - 3am Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Insomniac Humor.

## What is this

A chimera of my own making from codewithsadee's intelligent HTML skeletal structure - inspired at the stroke of midnight on a boiling August night in the middle of the week

## Why

I spent a year trying to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and all I really learned was how to center a div and take the best parts of someone else's MIT licensed code and break it. That's what I get for wiring my brain with Electrical Engineering at UIUC.

But I managed to make my own website to hold all my "schtuff", which in my humble opinion is looking pretty darn good.
While I'm still waiting for my family to actually acknowledge the time I spent and the hard work I did, I've been conscripted to make my little brother a website as well... because apparently nobody can be bothered to open wix.com or just ask me nicely...

So thank you @codewithsadee for making these templates, and please excuse me while I butcher the hell out of your sculpted HTML

As always, retrieved using git, edited in vim/neovim, and uploaded from a Linux machine
(BTW I use Arch)
